# Web Code Challenge â€” Flight Inspirations Admin Dashboard

This project was built as part of a technical task to demonstrate frontend integration skills, API usage, UI/UX enhancements.  
It is based on an existing codebase with editable table functionality using TanStack Table.

While implementing the flight search feature, I discovered that the /search endpoint consistently returned a 404 Not Found error for most cities except MAD (Madrid). This issue is documented with screenshots for reference, showing it occurred during development. A fallback and an error-handling mechanism has been implemented, but a fully functional multi-city demo may depend on backend/API resolution.

To ensure a realistic and reviewable implementation, I chose not to fully refactor the existing codebase. Instead, I worked within the current structure, making localized improvements where necessary. This approach helps maintain continuity with the existing code and demonstrates how real-world tasks are often completed in incremental steps.

## Features Implemented

- API integration with Amadeus Flight Inspiration Search
- Search form with inputs for origin city code and departure date
- Column filtering
- Editable table with cell-level editing and a save button to clear dirty state
- Client-level caching
- Drag-and-drop reordering of table columns
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Client-side pagination
